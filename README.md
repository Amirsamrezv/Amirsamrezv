Hi, I'm 22 years old, I'm a tech geek, because I started learning programming and stuff on youtube and other sites. I created this GitHub account to learn things like: html & css & javascript & Bootstrap & sass & react

I love rubik's cube or board games like chess, checkers and other games, by the way, I create things about this, like the CanUseTimer app, it's my best project for a while.
